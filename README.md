## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

We follow the official [Dart style guide](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style). Please ensure your code follows these conventions before submitting PRs.

### Architecture

AgriTrack follows a clean architecture approach with the following layers:
- **Presentation Layer**: UI components, screens, widgets
- **Domain Layer**: Business logic, use cases
- **Data Layer**: Data sources, repositories, models

### State Management

We use the BLoC pattern for state management. Please follow these guidelines:
- Create separate BLoCs for different features
- Keep BLoC logic simple and focused
- Use events for user interactions
- Use states to represent UI states

### Committing Code

- Follow conventional commit messages
- Keep commits small and focused
- Write descriptive PR descriptions

## Testing
